pedigreeTools
=========
The ```pedigreeTools``` package offers a suit of functions for pedigree analyses, 
including: sorting and editing pedigree data, computing inbreeding, 
additive relationships and functions of it (e.g., cholesky derived from a pedigree, 
inverse of a numerator relationship matrix). The package was originally 
co-developed by Douglas M. Bates and Ana I. Vazquez and was incorporated in 
the [lme4](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lme4) R-package. Recently, 
pedigreeTools evolved to an stand-alone package. We have added new 
features for pedigree edition, analysis of data from self-pollination 
and for subsetting pedigrees.

Developers: Ana I. Vazquez, Douglas M. Bates.
Paulino Perez-Rodriguez, G. de los Campos & S. Avadhanam.
